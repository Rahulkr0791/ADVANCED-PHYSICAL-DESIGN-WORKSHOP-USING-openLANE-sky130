# ADVANCED PHYSICAL DESIGN WORKSHOP USING openLANE-sky130
This repository contains the whole summary of hands on done during the workshop "Advance Physical Design Workshop using openLANE and Google - skywater 130 nm pdk" organised by VSD. The full RTL to GDSII flow was implemented for PICORV32A- a RISC-V based CPU core.

# Day 1

    o We are introduced to the internal structure of a computer using an example of a microcontroller board.
    
    o Terms like Board and chip design, Integrated circuits, die,packaging, IP and Foundry IP, and macros are explained.
    
    o RISC-V instruction set architecture is introduced along with the mention of other popular architectures like ARM and x86. This is         done because the design on which we are gonna work is RISC-V based picorv32a CPU core.
    
    o An introduction to SoC is given i.e. what is a SoC, how is it laid out is explained using examples of processors, memories and IPs.
